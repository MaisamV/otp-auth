# Development Guidelines

## Overview
This document establishes the development standards and practices that must be followed by all contributors (human and AI) working on the OTP Authentication Backend Service.

---

## üéØ **General Principles**

### **SOLID Principles**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### **Clean Code Principles**
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't implement features until needed
- **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave code cleaner than you found it

## üìù **Coding Standards**

### **Go Language Standards**

#### **Formatting**
- Use `gofmt` for automatic formatting
- Use `goimports` for import organization
- Line length: Maximum 120 characters
- Indentation: Use tabs, not spaces
- No trailing whitespace

#### **Naming Conventions**

**Variables:**
- Use camelCase for local variables: `userID`, `phoneNumber`
- Use short names for short-lived variables: `i`, `err`, `ctx`
- Use descriptive names for longer-lived variables: `refreshTokenRepository`

**Functions:**
- Use PascalCase for exported functions: `GenerateOTP()`, `ValidateToken()`
- Use camelCase for private functions: `hashPassword()`, `generateSessionID()`
- Use verb-noun pattern: `CreateUser()`, `SendOTP()`, `ValidatePhone()`

**Types:**
- Use PascalCase for all types: `User`, `PhoneNumber`, `OTPRequest`
- Use descriptive names: `UserRepository` not `UR`
- Interface names should describe behavior: `TokenGenerator`, `OTPSender`

**Constants:**
- Use PascalCase for exported constants: `DefaultOTPLength`
- Use camelCase for private constants: `maxRetryAttempts`
- Group related constants in blocks

**Packages:**
- Use lowercase, single word when possible: `domain`, `handlers`, `postgres`
- Use descriptive names: `usecases` not `uc`
- Avoid abbreviations: `repositories` not `repos`

#### **File Organization**
- One primary type per file
- File names should match primary type: `user.go` for `User` type
- Use snake_case for file names: `user_repository.go`
- Group related functionality in same package

#### **Import Organization**
- Standard library imports first
- Third-party imports second
- Local imports last
- Separate groups with blank lines
- Use blank imports only when necessary

#### **Error Handling**
- Always handle errors explicitly
- Use custom error types for domain errors
- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf`
- Return errors as last return value
- Use early returns to reduce nesting

#### **Comments and Documentation**
- All exported functions must have comments
- Comments should explain "why", not "what"
- Use complete sentences in comments
- Start comments with the function/type name
- Use `//` for single-line comments
- Use `/* */` for multi-line comments only when necessary

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Guidelines**

### **Layer Separation**
- **Domain Layer**: No dependencies on external packages
- **Application Layer**: Can depend only on domain layer
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Can depend on application and domain layers
- Never import from outer layers to inner layers

### **Dependency Injection**
- Use constructor injection for dependencies
- Inject interfaces, not concrete types
- Keep constructors simple and focused
- Validate dependencies in constructors

### **Interface Design**
- Keep interfaces small and focused
- Define interfaces in the package that uses them
- Use composition over inheritance
- Prefer many small interfaces over few large ones

### **Repository Pattern**
- Separate read and write operations
- Use context for all repository methods
- Return domain entities, not database models
- Handle database-specific errors in repository layer

---

## üß™ **Testing Guidelines**

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

### **Test Organization**
- Place tests in same package as code being tested
- Use `_test.go` suffix for test files
- One test file per source file when possible
- Group related tests in test suites

### **Test Naming**
- Use `TestFunctionName_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern
- Be descriptive: `TestSendOTP_ValidPhoneNumber_ReturnsSuccess`
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios

### **Test Structure**
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use meaningful test data
- Clean up resources in test teardown
- Use test helpers to reduce duplication

### **Mocking Guidelines**
- Mock external dependencies only
- Use interface-based mocking
- Keep mocks simple and focused
- Verify mock expectations in tests

### **Integration Testing**
- Use test containers for real database testing
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Ensure tests are isolated and repeatable

## üîí **Security Guidelines**

### **Data Protection**
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, OTPs)
- Hash all passwords and OTPs before storage
- Use secure random number generation
- Validate all input data

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- Use strong cryptographic algorithms (ECDSA, bcrypt)
- Implement proper session management
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting for all endpoints

### **Error Handling**
- Don't expose internal system details in error messages
- Use generic error messages for security-sensitive operations
- Log detailed errors internally for debugging
- Implement proper error codes for client applications

### **Configuration**
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper key rotation procedures
- Use secure defaults for all configuration options

## üìä **Performance Guidelines**

### **Database Operations**
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper indexing strategy
- Use prepared statements for repeated queries
- Avoid N+1 query problems

### **Caching Strategy**
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use appropriate TTL values
- Implement cache invalidation strategies
- Monitor cache hit rates

### **Memory Management**
- Avoid memory leaks in long-running processes
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Monitor memory usage in production

### **Concurrency**
- Use goroutines for I/O-bound operations
- Implement proper synchronization mechanisms
- Avoid race conditions
- Use context for cancellation and timeouts
